# Installation

## Install the package

All you need to do to get started is add Laravel Lang to your composer dependencies:

```bash:no-line-numbers
composer require laravel-lang/publisher laravel-lang/attributes --dev
```

To automate the process, then use our [publisher](https://publisher.laravel-lang.com).
